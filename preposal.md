# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create a program that will pool from my spotify library and give me a playlist based on mood or keywords, or something of that sort maybe because I want to force myself to start using playlists again. 

I want to create a game of sorts, maybe just a side scrolling walking simulator since that would be easier than learning how to make or import assets for a program like unity etc but i'm overall less inclined towards the game idea.

My spending habits have concerned me this past year so maybe a program that allows me to keep track of what music albums or knick knacks I buy when I go out to keep myself more accountable for my purchases would be a fun way of doing so.
